We made this 'ShooterSpace' project using Unity 3d game engine and we used C# as the main scripting language. 
Generally we are satisfied with Unity because of its ease of use. 
The most challenging part of doing this project was to find a good way to control all shooting objects. 
The UML diagram (I'm not sure if it is pure UML) is showing how most important parts of the game are interacting with each other. 
For example the diagram shows that turrets and enemies are using same weapon scripts (partly). 

There are a lot of things that we didn't manage to do before deadline, for example:
-differenr enemy ships (there are 2 additional models in the files though!)
-boss (which is one of the models in the data files)
-more levels
-radar (we had a clear idea on how to implement this but just didn't have enough time)
-boosts
etc

Some of these are partly made but they didn't make it in time. 

We will probably continue developing this game further and I think the first thing to do is massive refactoring.
