We made this 'ShooterSpace' project unsing Unity 3d game engine anf we used C# as the main scripting language. 
Generally we are satisfied with Unity because of it's easiness. 
The most challengin part of doing this project was to find a good way to control all shooting objects. 
That UML diagram (i'm not sure if it is pure UML) is showing how the most important parts if the game are interacting with each other. 
For example the diagram shows that turrets and enemies are using same weapon scripts (partly). 

There is a lot of things that we didn't manage to do before deadline, for example:
-differend enemy ships
-boss
-more levels
-radar
-boosts
etc

Some of these are partly made but they didn't make it in time. 

But probably we will continue developing this game further and I think the first thing to do is massive refactoring.
